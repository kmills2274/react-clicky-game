# react-clicky-game

World Cities Travel Game (react-clicky-game) is a memory game made with React.

**Game Play:**

*The game starts when the page loads. The initial score is set to 0.

*The app renders images to the screen.

*Every time an image is clicked, the images will shuffle in a random order.

*The app keeps track of the player's score. The player's score increases when they click on an image for the first time. The player's score will reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once before clicking on all of the images once.

*The player's score is then reset to '0' and the game will restart.
